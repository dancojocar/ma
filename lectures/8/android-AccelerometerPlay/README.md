Android AccelerometerPlay Sample
===================================

Sample demonstrating how to use an accelerometer sensor as input for a physics-based view.

Introduction
------------

This sample demonstrates how to use an accelerometer [sensor][1] as input for
a physics-based view. The input from the accelerometer is used to simulate a
virtual surface, and a number of free-moving objects placed on top of it.

<p>Any effects from the device's acceleration vector (including both gravity and
temporary movement) will be translated to the on-screen particles.
