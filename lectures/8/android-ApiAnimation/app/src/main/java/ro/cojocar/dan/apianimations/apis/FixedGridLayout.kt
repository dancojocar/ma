/**
 * A layout that arranges its children in a grid.  The size of the
 * cells is set by the [.setCellSize] method and the
 * android:cell_width and android:cell_height attributes in XML.
 * The number of rows and columns is determined at runtime.  Each
 * cell contains exactly one view, and they flow in the natural
 * child order (the order in which they were added, or the index
 * in [.addViewAt].  Views can not span multiple cells.

 * This class was copied from the FixedGridLayout Api demo; see that demo for
