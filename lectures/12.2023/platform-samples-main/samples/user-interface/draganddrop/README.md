# Drag and Drop

An android application demonstrating basic Drag and Drop functionality using the
[`Jetpack Drag and Drop Library`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/draganddrop).

Allows for plain-text items and images to be dragged into the app. Has a plain-text item and a PNG
item that can be dragged within, out of, or to a second instance of the demo.

Utilizes [`androidx.core`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/core)'s
[`DragStartHelper`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/core/view/DragStartHelper)
and [`androidx.draganddrop`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/draganddrop)'s
[`DropHelper`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/draganddrop/DropHelper) to
simplify the process of implementing both dragging and dropping functionality.
