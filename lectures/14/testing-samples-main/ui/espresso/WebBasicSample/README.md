# Basic sample for Espresso Web

Espresso Web is an API that can be used to write automated tests for hybrid applications which
contain one or more WebViews. Similar to onData, WebView interactions are actually composed of
several ViewActions, however ViewActions in Espresso Web are composed of Web Driver Atoms.
Espresso Web takes care of synchronization and tries to minimize boilerplate to a bare minimum,
while still giving you an Espresso-like feel to interacting with WebViews.

This project uses the Gradle build system. You don't need an IDE to build and execute it but Android Studio is recommended.

1. Download the project code, preferably using `git clone`.
1. Open the Android SDK Manager (*Tools* Menu | *Android*) and make sure you have installed the *Android Support Repository* under *Extras*. (For more Information click [here](http://developer.android.com/tools/testing-support-library/index.html#setup))
1. In Android Studio, select *File* | *Open...* and point to the `./build.gradle` file.
1. Check out the relevant code:
    * The application under test is located in `src/main/java`
    * Tests are in `src/androidTest/java`
1. Create the test configuration with a custom runner: `androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner`
    * Open *Run* menu | *Edit Configurations*
    * Add a new *Android Tests* configuration
    * Choose a module
    * Add a *Specific instrumentation runner*: `androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner`
1. Connect a device or start an emulator
    * Turn animations off.
    (On your device, under Settings->Developer options disable the following 3 settings: "Window animation scale", "Transition animation scale" and "Animator duration scale")
1. Run the newly created configuration

The application will be started on the device/emulator and a series of actions will be performed automatically.

If you are using Android Studio, the *Run* window will show the test results.
