# Trivial Drive Kotlin

Sample for In-App Billing version 3

## Introduction

This sample is provided to demonstrate Google Play In-app Billing for very large (or very small) apps.
To read more visit https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/index.html

This game is a simple "driving" game where the player can buy gas and drive. The
car has a tank which stores gas. When the player purchases gas, the tank fills
up (1/4 tank at a time). When the player drives, the gas in the tank diminishes
(also 1/4 tank at a time).

The user can also purchase a "premium upgrade" that gives them a red car instead
of the standard blue one (exciting!).

The user can also purchase a subscription ("gold status") that allows them to
drive with a gold car background while that subscription is active. The
subscription can either be purchased monthly or yearly.

## Getting Started

This sample can be run as-is. However, you are encouraged to create your own
application instance in the Developer Console and modify this
sample to point to it. Here is what you should do:

ON THE GOOGLE PLAY DEVELOPER CONSOLE

1. Create an application on the Developer Console, available at
   https://play.google.com/apps/publish/.

2. Copy the application's public key (a base-64 string). You can find this in
   the "Services & APIs" section under "Licensing & In-App Billing".

IN THE CODE

1.  Open Security.kt, find the declaration of BASE_64_ENCODED_PUBLIC_KEY
    constant and replace its value with the public key you retrieved in Step 2.

2.  Change the sample's package name to your package name.
    You can update the package name by setting the `APP_ID`
    in the root project `build.gradle` file.

3.  Update `keystore.properties` with your release keystore information.
    https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html#secure-shared-keystore

    The storeFile location can be a relative or absolute filename.
    https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/working_with_files.html

    Or, you can sign your APK from Android Studio "Build -> Generate Signed APK..."

BACK TO THE GOOGLE PLAY DEVELOPER CONSOLE

1.  Upload your APK to Google Play for Alpha Testing.

2.  Make sure to add your test account (the one you will use to test purchases)
    to the "testers" section of your app. Your test account CANNOT BE THE SAME
    AS THE PUBLISHER ACCOUNT. If it is, your purchases won't go through.

3.  Under In-app Products, create MANAGED in-app items with these IDs: "premium_car"
    and "gas". Fill in their prices and other fields. Set them to "Active".

4.  Under In-app Products, create SUBSCRIPTION items with these IDs:
    "gold_monthly" and "gold_yearly". Fill their prices and other fields. Set them to "Active".

5.  Publish your APK to the Alpha channel. Wait 2-3 hours for Google Play to
    process the APK. If you don't wait for Google Play to process the APK, you
    might see errors where Google Play says that "this version of the
    application is not enabled for in-app billing" or something similar.

6.  Also always make sure that the uploaded application has the same version as
    the one you are testing.

TEST THE CODE

11. Install the APK signed with your PRODUCTION certificate, to a
test device [*].
12. Run the app.
13. Make purchases using the test account you added in Step 7.

If you don't want your credit card to be charged, you can include your test
account inside the list of "testing access". To know more about this, please
read the section "Setting up test purchases" inside the following guide:
https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_testing.html


Otherwise, you can refund any real purchases you make, to avoid the charges.

[*]: it will be easier to use a test device that doesn't have your
developer account logged in; this is because, if you attempt to purchase
an in-app item using the same account that you used to publish the app,
the purchase will not go through.

## A NOTE ABOUT SECURITY

This sample app implements signature verification but does not demonstrate
how to enforce a tight security model. When releasing a production application
to the general public, we highly recommend that you implement the security best
practices described in our documentation at:

http://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_best_practices.html

In particular, you should perform a security check on your backend.
