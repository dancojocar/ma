This module contains samples that shows how your app can
[minimize the visibility](src/main/java/com/example/platform/privacy/data/PackageVisibility.kt) into
the set of other installed apps and your use of non-resettable device identifiers by using
[Package Visibility APIs](https://developer.android.com/training/package-visibility/declaring) and
appropriated [identifiers](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids#common-use-cases).
