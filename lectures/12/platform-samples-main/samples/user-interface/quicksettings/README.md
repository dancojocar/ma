Quick Settings
==============

Quick Settings are tiles displayed above notifications in the status bar drawer. Apps can create
custom tiles, and users can add them to Quick Settings.

This sample demonstrates the most typical kind of tiles, the one that users can tap to toggle its
active/inactive state. For other kinds of tiles, check out
"[Create custom Quick Settings tiles for your app][1]".
