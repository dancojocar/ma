Android Sharesheet provides the consistent user experience for any type of data your app sends to
other apps.

In this sample, we use [ShareCompat][1] to share various types of data:

Android Sharesheet also provides these customization options that cover all the practical use cases
you might need in your app.

- Know which app has received the data (API level 22+)
- Exclude target candidates (API level 24+)
- Add custom actions (API level 34+)
