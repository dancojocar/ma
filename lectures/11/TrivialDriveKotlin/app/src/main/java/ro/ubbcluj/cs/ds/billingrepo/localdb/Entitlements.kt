/**
 * For this app the decision was made to create an [Entity] class for each product and feature that
 * the app sells. It was further decided to put all of them in one file. You don't have to do it
 * this way. But here is why it's done that way here:
 *
 * 1 - The only way for the users to have offline access to their entitlements is if they are saved
 *     somehow. It is more convenient to use Room instead of, say, SharedPreferences.
 *
 * 2 - It may seem like an overkill to create an entire class just to persist a Boolean, as in the
 *      case of [GoldStatus]. Yes and no. Putting it inside Room means it can be tracked using
 *      LiveData without the clients having to write too much code. Also maybe later there will
 *      be needs to add more fields, such as the status of the subscription.
 *
 * 3 - Grouping all the app's products and subscriptions in one file called Entitlements seem
 *      effective.
