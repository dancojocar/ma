 *
 * FOREWORD:
 *
 * To avoid ambiguity and for simplified readability:
 *
 *  - the term "user" shall refer to people who download the app and buy
 *    products or subscriptions.
 *
 *  - the term "client" shall refer to those developers/engineers on the team who depend on the
 *    billing repository as an API.
 *
 * GOVERNING ARCHITECTURE:
 *
 * A Google Play Billing implementation depends on purchase confirmation data from three different
 * data sources: the Google Play Billing service, a secure server, and the app's own local cache.
 * A repository module is needed to manage these different data sources and associated operations
 * so that the rest of the app can access this data. Let this module be called [BillingRepository].
 * And this module shall handle all interactions with the
 * _Play Billing Library_, the billing portions of a secure server, and the billing portions of
 * the app’s local cache.
 *
 * What the rest of the app gets, then, is an API in the form of a ViewModel that comprises:
 * a list of inventory (i.e. what’s for sale); a purchase function (i.e. how to buy); and a set
 * of entitlements (i.e. what the user owns). This recommended structure removes some of the
 * complexities of Google Play Billing. Managed products, consumable products, subscriptions, and
 * other product types are handled identically through a unified API.
 *
 * What this also means is that all of the work is now concentrated in one module, the
 * [BillingRepository]. This repository shall track everything the app is selling and how the app
 * is selling them. The app should not be selling anything that's not listed in this
 * repository. Therefore, the engineers responsible for implementing the [BillingRepository]
 * need to fully understand the app's business model.
 *
 * Figure 1 shows the app from the perspective of the billing module.

 *
 * DATA DYNAMICS:
 *
 * It’s important to consider data mechanics when designing a feature as crucial as the
 * app’s billing repository. Where the billing data rests and how it flows through the repository
 * are central aspects of the design.
 *
 * The Google Play Billing Library 2.0 and above (PBL 2.0+) enables us to draw sharp distinction
 * amongst three primary implementations of billing:
 *
 * 1- Billing integration with no offline access to entitlements
 *
 * 2- Server-reliant billing integration with offline access to some entitlements
 *
 * 3- Serverless billing integration
 *
 * While these three primary integrations do have possible combined derivatives, in the coming
 * weeks we will provide samples or codelabs that address each of these primary integrations.
 *
 * The following three figures depict each model:

 *
 * Figures 2 and 3 process the purchases and disburse the entitlements on the remote server. But
 * Figure 4, being serverless, processes everything inside the Android app. This present sample
 * will follow the flow depicted in Figure 4.
 *
 * Here is a bit more detail on the flow depicted in Figure 4:
 *
 * 1. [launchBillingFlow] and [queryPurchasesAsync] can be called directly from the client:
 *   [launchBillingFlow] may be triggered by a button click when the user wants to buy something;
 *   [queryPurchasesAsync] may be triggered when the app launches, by a pull-to-refresh or an
 *   [Activity] lifecycle event. Hence, they are the starting points in the process.
 *
 * 2. [onPurchasesUpdated] is the callback that the Play [BillingClient] calls in response to its
 *    [launchBillingFlow][BillingClient.launchBillingFlow] being called. If the response code is
 *    [BillingClient.BillingResponseCode.OK], then developers may go straight to [processPurchases]. If, however, the
 *    response code is [BillingClient.BillingResponseCode.ITEM_ALREADY_OWNED], then developers should call
 *    [queryPurchasesAsync] to verify if other such already-owned items exist that should be
 *    processed.
 *
 * 3. The [queryPurchasesAsync] method grabs all the active purchases of this user and makes them
 *    available to this app instance. Calling Play's [BillingClient] multiple times is relatively
 *    cheap; it involves no network calls since Play stores the data in its own local cache. The
 *    purchase data is then [processed][processPurchases] and converted to
 *    [premium contents][Entitlement].
 *
 * 4. Finally, all data that end up as part of the public interface of the [BillingRepository]
 *    (i.e. in the [BillingViewModel]), and therefore in other portions of the app, come immediately
 *    from the local cache billing client. The local cache is backed by a [Room] database and all
 *    the data visible to the clients is wrapped in [LiveData] so that changes are reflected in
 *    the clients as soon as they happen.
 *
 *
 * ```
 *
 * FINAL THOUGHT
 *
 * We strongly recommend that you implement Figure 3 or Figure 2 in your app. However, the
 * implementation for Figure 4 is provided for apps that do not already have a server component
 * and do not wish to create one just for Google Play Billing.
 *
 * While the architecture presented here and most of the code is highly reusable, this repository
 * is app-specific. For Trivial Drive, for example, it is tailored to sell three items: a premium
 * car, gas for driving, and gold status. Consequently, this repo must handle logic that
 * deals with what it means for a user to own a premium car or buy gas.
 *

    /**
     * The [BillingClient] is the most reliable and primary source of truth for all purchases
     * made through the Google Play Store. The Play Store takes security precautions in guarding
     * the data. Also, the data is available offline in most cases, which means the app incurs no
     * network charges for checking for purchases using the [BillingClient]. The offline bit is
     * because the Play Store caches every purchase the user owns, in an
     * [eventually consistent manner](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_library_overview#Keep-up-to-date).
     * This is the only billing client an app is actually required to have on Android. The other
     * two (webServerBillingClient and localCacheBillingClient) are optional.
     *
     * ASIDE. Notice that the connection to [playStoreBillingClient] is created using the
     * applicationContext. This means the instance is not [Activity]-specific. And since it's also
     * not expensive, it can remain open for the life of the entire [Application]. So whether it is

     * BACKGROUND
     *
     * Google Play Billing refers to receipts as [Purchases][Purchase]. So when a user buys
     * something, Play Billing returns a [Purchase] object that the app then uses to release the
     * [Entitlement] to the user. Receipts are pivotal within the [BillingRepository]; but they are
     * not part of the repo’s public API, because clients don’t need to know about them. When
     * the release of entitlements occurs depends on the type of purchase. For consumable products,
     * the release may be deferred until after consumption by Google Play; for non-consumable
     * products and subscriptions, the release may be deferred until after
     * [BillingClient.acknowledgePurchaseAsync] is called. You should keep receipts in the local
     * cache for augmented security and for making some transactions easier.
     *
     * THIS METHOD
     *
     * [This method][queryPurchasesAsync] grabs all the active purchases of this user and makes them
     * available to this app instance. Whereas this method plays a central role in the billing
     * system, it should be called at key junctures, such as when user the app starts.
     *
     * Because purchase data is vital to the rest of the app, this method is called each time
     * the [BillingViewModel] successfully establishes connection with the Play [BillingClient]:
     * the call comes through [onBillingSetupFinished]. Recall also from Figure 4 that this method
     * gets called from inside [onPurchasesUpdated] in the event that a purchase is "already
     * owned," which can happen if a user buys the item around the same time
     * on a different device.
